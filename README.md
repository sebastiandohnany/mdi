# Military Deployment Index
## Measure of military power, commitment and burden-sharing

The Military Deployment Index is a new measure of military deployability across the globe. It can be used to assess military power, commitment and burden-sharing, whether you wish to know more about a specific country, compare more cases or conduct a large-N study. The index combines annual data on absolute troop deployments with data adjusted to population to create a variable that is both more complex and accurate than existent measures. Thanks to its composition, the index offers insight into the ability as well as the willingness of states to deploy troops. It ranges from 1 to 10 and varies each year. See our Methodology for more details.
